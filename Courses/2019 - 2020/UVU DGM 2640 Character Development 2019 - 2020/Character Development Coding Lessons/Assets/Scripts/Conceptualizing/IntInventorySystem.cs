     /*
     Concept: use scriptable objects as containers for integer data.
     Each Scriptable Object is an actual "item" in the inventory.
     The inventory UI is just for show.
     All inventory is just disabled so long as its value is below a set threshold (0).
     In game "items" simply have an integer value.
     The in game item value is added to the scriptable object container
     When value is above the threshold, it enables use of the inventory item.
     
     requirements:
     1. Inventory list planned out
     2. Scriptable Object for Integers 
     3. ??
